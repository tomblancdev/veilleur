# Anyone can run this thing. Their addresses, hostnames, domains, VLAN and
# group names and house word live in whatever configuration manages it, and
# the only thing crossing between that and this repo is a pinned tag. So the
# examples and the tests here describe nowhere: they use the reserves the
# RFCs set aside for documentation, which are guaranteed never to be anybody.

# Note what this does NOT do: it carries no list of forbidden names. A
# denylist of somebody's hostnames would be that somebody's environment,
# published here, in the one file the check could never look at. Whoever runs
# this keeps that list in their own repo, where those names belong.
#
# Every MATCH is judged, not every line: a line that migrates 10.0.0.1 to
# 192.0.2.1 must not pass because the good address is standing next to the
# bad one. A value that genuinely has to be real marks its line with a
# trailing `no-environment: ok`.
